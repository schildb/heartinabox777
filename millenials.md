We are millennials, generation Y or God forbid, hipsters. 
We’ve been criticized as being so entrepreneurial that our communities are mere networks and our friends just potential customers (William Deresiewicz). 

Quote Mr. Black (sam Jackson) from Sunset limited on reaching out to your fellow man 

Terence Mckenna on how culture is not your friend. 

Ray Appenheimer: you can’t have it all in terms of the maximal level of excitement 
Kenny Werner echoes the sentiment “life is not fruit loops and movie star sex”

Beta blockers among conservatory students 

Psychiatric drugs in general and their contraindications. 
The de-funding of the DSM by the NIMH in favor of neurobiological models of mental health (illness). 
Mental illnesses as poor natural kinds.
The stigma of being assigned an “abnormal” label. Who do labels help? 
Is there a right answer to the label question? 
Does it matter whether the label is true or should we be more nihilistic about that question and just pick one and go with it? 

Paternalism of Res Ed and the limitations of the administrative bureaucracy coalesce around the largest factor in their decision making namely avoiding litigation or minimizing culpability in the pursuit thereof. 

Deresiewicz’s point that we fear being alone (huddled masses of freshmen)

Students echo similar concerns that point to the source of the collective malaise. 
We all set perhaps too high of standards for ourselves, spread our time and attention over too many interests and pursuits. 
We look at others and only see their game face. 
“they must be tackling their schedule and handling everything better than I am” and therefore I should hate myself for failing to keep cool through it all. 

I fear that we have taken the attitude of hating others for their apparent gifts and talents that we see in them out of envy and disregard for our own. 
These x number of reasons are why I have it harder than that person etc. 

My favorite piece of folk psychology is the idea that people tend to look for reasons to justify what they believe continually. (bias confirmation) 
If you see someone that you don’t know how to react towards (you find them attractive, intimidating etc) it’s probably best to reserve judgment lest you look for reasons to hate what you can’t have simply because it’s easier. 
Somehow this attitude seems tied to a protestant work ethic that values suffering as a necessary condition for a virtuous life and worthwhile work. 
This combined with a proto Marxian value theory which regards the value of goods based on the amount of labor mixed necessary to create them. 

There is nothing for which sacrificing your mental and physical wellbeing is worth the cost. 
Your degree can wait. 
Address your concerns now before you graduate and find yourself without the security and comfort of housing, food and purpose. 
Before you get too snarky and cynical ask yourself “would I feel justified in saying that if I didn’t have all the various aspects of my current safety blanket?” 

“go home hipsters” rock painted message

I feel readily discouraged about the veracity of own beliefs when in retrospect they’re pretty much a carbon copy of Ted Kacynsky’s views on why modern industrial societies create unhappy people. 

Terence Mckenna: take back your mind! Understand the effects of food, alcohol and physical activity in terms of their addictive potential. 
They are drugs in themselves and despite what purveyors of inherited wisdom would have you believe this consideration will play an integral role in whatever kind of neurobiological model of mental health that comes about. 

The affectations of modern medicine are that pharmaceuticals can be made with one controlled method of action, in a pure form with precise delivery and that drug therapies that follow this particular value set are inherently desirable and readily producible. 
That for every plant remedy there must be derived a precise chemical constituent. 
Disregard active kinesthetic therapies when medical science can’t explain them for lack of its own proscriptive model of health. 

Can we be mature and rational about what religious, athletic, musical practices do for us? 
That they fulfill and inculcate basic biological feedbacks like patterned breathing which then functions as an anxiolytic. 
That people of diverse religious background may induce bonding, boundary dissolving experiences, and spiritual revelations couched in cultural terms and practices that make them incompatible but render the same fMRI signal. 
This may be an uncomfortable suggestion that we ought follow a universalist Unitarian model but consider the alternative, more arbitrary fighting over the authenticity and veracity of spiritual paths and experiences. 

Can we step back for a moment and agree that it’s Ok to engage in ‘magical’ thinking? To believe in God, Allah, Christ, Rama, or jehova not to mention Buddhist, animistic, pantheistic and ancestor worship cosmologies does not make one an intellectual miscreant. 

We could have gone in a different direction with the ObieTalk issue, One in which we recognize anonymous speech as constitutionally protected. 
Sorry China, but gossip laws are stupid and draconian. 
There will always be haters and those who view other people as a means to their ends. 
Just as 3D printing has exposed the enforcement of gun control to be a hollow expression of expedience and pragmatism when laughable but serious attempts are made to outlaw the dissemination of information on the internet or prohibit the use of a technology in a way tantamount to obscenity control on your inkjet, it is clear that one cannot simply ban a medium on the basis of the features by which it is accessible. 
We might as well petition for the removal of bathroom stall doors for they too are a ready forum for reputation ruin. 

What is the relationship between residential college accommodations and the attitudes endemic to liberal arts students? 
Housing and dining are meant to seem like they’re safe and contained systems. 
Dining is unlimited and cash free. 
These systems although well meaning in their intention to create an environment in which students worry only about their work often have the unintended consequence of inculcating a work hard play hard dynamic. 
If you don’t have to clean up after yourself, pay rent, buy food, or even like your work or the people around you then how does one not fall into patterns that over extend oneself without executive override? 
Goal driven people will likely obfuscate all other relevant parts of their well-being in order to attain the goal at hand. 

Psychology may define the problem as people considering their bodies as machines. 
That may be true but athletic trainers and coaches do the same to differing degrees of effectiveness. 
If somatic models are undertaken subconsciously or explicitly that neglect the fourth dimensional properties of muscle alignment and movement patterns this will lead to injury. 
If patterns are stressed first and increased loads are then added adaptation may proceed without interruption. 
If however loads are increased without attention to patterns first then some critical factor like overused minor muscle groups will max out their hypertrophy or load capacity and fail. 
Often coaches, trainers, and athletes are left without adequate biofeedback benchmarks that can signal desired ranges of stress to the physical system. 
Resting heart rate upon wakeup, lactate levels prior post and during activities, pulse oximetry, blood glucose/insulin, salivary cortisol are all relevant benchmarks for understanding the dynamic stressors for the student athlete. 

Be actively engaged with your work. 
Read ahead, read the whole textbook, take classes that readily interest you and minimize the number of courses that do not or are not at least required for graduation/major requirements. 

Students should not take lightly the implications of drastically changing their diet, schedule, workload, athletic training. 
Fatigue can result from a number of sources including but not limited to stress, sleep deprivation, over-training, anemia, injury, vitamin deficiency, caloric/sugar insufficiency. 

In addition to taking care of oneself physically students should keep in mind how the skills and habits they develop in school will translate into the real world. Do you like your field of study enough to work in it? Have you already experienced work in this field? 
Where will you live and how will those accommodations differ from what you experienced in school? 
Will you be able to live with or near your friends? 
What’s your backup plan in all cases? 
It’s important to reach for ones dreams but any aspiration must be tempered by the sober realism of what is the next step to fulfilling that goal? 

What could be more important than your health? 
The patterns we inculcate in college are potentially the ones that we extend to the rest of our lives. 
To continually put off rest and live in constant exhaustion is to be on track for inevitable health catastrophe. 
To be driven by anxiety in all actions leaves one living for the future chasing the next rush of excitement unable to catch ones breath. 
If you feel too impatient to walk to your destination with enough time and instead pedal your bicycle in a high gear with great effort in order to avoid having to greet people you already know. 
Take your time, gear down your bike and pedal at a faster cadence with less exertion. 
In as much as it is motivating to frame your life in terms of a great struggle in which you’re doing everything you possibly can to maximize your schedule and get everything out of your limited time here you may never get close to your intended goals. 
To proceed with only goals and no reflection on your present trajectory or regard for your state of health will end in ruin. We are the product of the character we cultivate through our actions and habits we create. 
Of course it’s true that your experience at Oberlin will not be reflective of your daily life outside the bubble. 
No amount of accreditation is worth your long-term health despite the potential for a large salary or stable position. 
What can we take away from PhDs who become artists or take up a musical instrument late in life? 
Perhaps the monomaniacal pursuit of a goal like a degree without regard for happiness is misguided at least. 

How can we create a campus culture in which it is OK to smile and validate each other without worrying that the consequences of our kindness. 
Worrying about your surplus of  obligations and thinking that everyone else is handling theirs swimmingly is part of the same mental space from which our reluctance to reach out socially extends. 
Could it really just be the weather that’s got everyone down? 

I’ve met too many physicians who neglect the environmental factors contributing to their own mental health. 
Environmental factors like altitude are never considered or given due credit for their role in depression, anxiety, movement disorders and dementia. 
The neurologist who drinks too much coffee thinks his calf cramps are due to a separate de novo nerve conduction issue.

We must somehow extend our understanding of environmental factors to the human environment as well. 
A culture of individuals otherwise driven to achieve abstract collective goals without regard for their own health and that of those around them will
