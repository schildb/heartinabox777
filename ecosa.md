Camp is parallel to East West trail. Willow poles and cross beams 
	Willow drills for fire making and yucca hearth if available

Willow and cattail structure (elongated parabola with enclosed end)
	willow poles and cross beams thatched with cattails

Thermal economy is prime

What you learned 
	process reflection 
	helped with program (design)

1. effects of water 
	creek cuts path through dells lowland 
	plants bend due to intermittent stream 
	Stream leaves granite soil/silt
	flooding clears and deposits seeds and vegetation
		plants bend and stay in place
		hydrostatic pressure rights them 
		plants uproot and reroot
	animals disappear with creek/stream 
	wind channels through valley or canyon 
		distributing pollen and seeds 
		low winds in this canyon allow 
		wind susceptible plants to flourish
	wind increases structural resilience in trees 
		shapes growth patterns
	Dew provides moisture in mornings and evenings 
		at dew point absorbed through roots
		prevents evaporation 
		moisture aids decomposition 
	frost and snow causes dormancy in plants 
		and hibernation or migration in animals
	Frost functions as a temporal threshold for seasonal cycle 
	
	stomatal closure
	
	snow persists and accumulates in shaded areas 
		recharging soil moisture 
			aquifers 
			runoff adds to bodies of water 
2. generalities of microclimates 
	shaded tree regions 
		bio mass from trees
		shade in shadows 
		food and shelter to animals 
	southern facing canyon wall exposure 
		seasonal variability in moisture 
		drought resistant plants/leaves (trichomes, leathery, waxy)
		warm climate for reptiles
3. conduction, convection and radiation
	conduction 
		heat is retained in rocks and boulders 
		ground is cold sink
		reptiles move accordingly 
	convection 
		variability in base of canyon versus rim
		bodies of water
		shaded regions
	Thermal radiation 
		warm rocks 
		cool shaded ground 
		color of rocks and surface 
	warm vs cold blooded 
		cold blooded organisms move to opposite 
		environments to maintain thermal equilibrium 
			scales
		warm blooded animals
			sweat to cool 
			fur to insulate
4. 	on lake 
		shore and radiating terrain 
		demonstrate thermal gradient
	in or below 
		strata demonstrate thermal gradient 
		soil and plants circulate and mix
5. 	spatial and temporal distribution of animals 
	influenced by body size and metabolic rate 
		larger animals avoid high temp time/exposure 
		small animals more active during high temp times
	black bear versus polar bears 
		mammals are 90% nocturnal 
6. viscosity of water and air
	particulate in air light 
	viscosity of water affects freezing and evaporation
		dissolved solids and salts
	viscosity is inversely proportional to temp 
	elevation affects atmospheric temp 
		and pressure
	Dissolved solids in water 
		affects light transmittance 
	surface tension (water striders)
		plants on surface of water 
			floor of lake
		based on photo demand
	fish move to different thermal strata 
		thermocline

		Displacement problem rather than population or toxicity 
	Dynamic Equilibrium (metabolic/catabolic parity)
		cultural and ritual as homoestat for carrying capacity 
		“pigs for the ancestors”
		systems out of balance (koyaanisqatsi)
	Sustainability 
		a dynamic equilibrium in the process of interaction between a population and its environment such that the population develops to express its full potential without producing irreversible adverse effects on the carrying capacity of the environment upon which it depends.
